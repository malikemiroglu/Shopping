 # Shopping App 
 I wanted to improve myself by making a shopping website example with the React library. I created my data among my files.

 - Cards listing products 
 - Adding, removing and deleting products from the cart 
 - A maximum of products in stock can be added to the cart. If the stock runs out, the add to cart button will be closed. 
 - The product is removed from the basket until only 1 product remains. 
 - View cart summary 
 - Discount coupon application. Type "discount" to apply the discount coupon.
